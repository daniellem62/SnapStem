## 🚀 About The Project

This project was to be a plant image identifier.

We wanted to make an app that could take and identify photos of your plant to provide care requirements for the (hopefully correctly) identified plant.

We also implemented a chat bot functionality so that you could ask specific questions regarding your plant.

## 🌟 Features

## Stretch goals

Some stretch goals for the project are to:

- Add plants to an inventory/wishlist.
- Set reminders for watering.
- Ask questions about plant health - why is my plant doing this eg curling leaves/browning leaves? What’s wrong with my plant? etc.
- Identify diseases by image
- Login page with authorisation
